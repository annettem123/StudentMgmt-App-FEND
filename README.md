    Project Description
	
    This project is built on a monolithic back-end using Spring Boot and its modules in IntelliJ IDE.  Database is built in PostreSQL and Tomcat runs the application. Postman is used to test the RESTful API endpoints. The front-end is using Angular platform and framework using HTML and TypeScript. 

2. Technical Info:
Persist 3 models (students, teachers, courses) to a PostgreSQL database.
Use Spring Profiles for environment settings.
At least one API endpoint will perform full CRUD create, read, update, and delete actions
Other API endpoints can perform CRUD based on the business use-case (service).
Expose CRUD routes that were built using REST conventions.
Handle exceptions gracefully.
Send appropriate messages back to the client in the event that an exception occurs.
Have Controller and Service separate.
Document each end-point, such that
